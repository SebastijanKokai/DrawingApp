Changes:
- Resources from absolute path to relative path
- ConcurrentModificationException solved with "new CopyOnWriteArrayList<Shape>();"
- NullPointerException solved with "selectedObjects = null" removed
- Delete works now
- Undo/redo works (Command pattern)
- Observer pattern (show btnDelete/Modify)



Still left to do:
- Log

Questions:
- How does deselect work?
- Do I select only the top object?
